- cluster_name: the name of the cluster. *Note: this script adds a prefix to the name: _spin-_
- mater-users: change the "arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user" with your _arn:aws:iam_ same for the "username".

## How to Use

    terraform init 
    terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
    terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars

## Result
